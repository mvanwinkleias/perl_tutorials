# Module Runtime Tutorial 1

This was an attempt to get a "full circle" example working with automatically loading a module at run time based off of some parameters.

A dispatch hash is used to "safely" load modules, and a try ... catch ... block is used to handle issues with modules loading.

To use it, just call **a_script.pl A B** .  Experiment.  Have fun.
